 - Back test my trading stratagies
 - Recreate classic algorithmic trading stratagies such as momentum trading and see how well they work in modern context 
 - Create new trading strategies using Neural networks and other Machine learning techniques
 - Create trading strategies using Reinforcement leaning and Genetic agorithms
